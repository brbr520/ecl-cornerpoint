## Synopsis

This project was created in order to generate Eclipse corner point grid files from Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) points. The UTM points should be obtained from reservoir structure maps and a net reservoir map to obtain top depth and reservoir height respectively.

The program generates COORD and ZCORN inputs for the Eclipse Reservoir Simulator. 

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
